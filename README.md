# catwhale-crochet
Crocheting and knitting have been a part of my life since i was a teenager. Now I want to share the joy of fibre crafts to the world! I teach all ages and levels; right or left handed! All you need is the passion and patience to learn! Never found the right blanket or toy to give a loved one? Reach out for one-off or special orders that are personal to you!
